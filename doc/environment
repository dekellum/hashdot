== HASHDOT_DEBUG ==

If set in the environment, verbose debug logging is enabled to
standard error.

== HASHDOT_PROFILE ==

If set in the environment, the value will be interpreted as a profile
to load (from normal profiles directory) immediately after the default
profile but before any script properties header is interpreted. This
provides a convient mechanism to test launching with hashdot a script
which does not yet contain a hashdot header.
